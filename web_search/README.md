# RAG Bootcamp: Web Search

This is a reference implementations for Vector Institute's **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Bootcamp**, taking place from Nov 2024 to Jan 2025. Popular LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama-3 are very good at natural language and sounding like humans, but their knowledge is limited by the data they were trained on. 

In this demo, we attempt to accurately answer open domain factual questions using LLMs by leveraging web search.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.10+
2. If running on the Vector cluster, load the `rag_dataloaders` env:
    ```bash
    source /ssd003/projects/aieng/public/rag_bootcamp/envs/rag_dataloaders/bin/activate
    ```
   **[Alternate]** Otherwise, create your own env and install packages using the `requirements.txt` file (make sure to run these commands in the top level dir of the repository):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ./rag_dataloaders
    source rag_dataloaders/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install -r ./envs/rag_dataloaders/requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install the jupyter kernel:
    ```bash
    ipython kernel install --user --name=rag_dataloaders
    ```
4. If you are accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's **Kaleidoscope Service** (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to set the KScope env variables:
    - Request a KScope API Key:
        Run the following command (replace `<user_id>` and `<password>`) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The `access_token` in the output is your KScope API Key.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -d "grant_type=password" -d "username=<user_id>" -d "password=<password>" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token
        ```
    - After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the `.kscope.env` file in your home directory (`/h/<user_id>`) and set the following env variables in that file:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/v1"
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=<kscope_api_key>
        ```
   **[Alternate]** If you using **OpenAI models** instead, set the env variables to the following values:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>
    ```
