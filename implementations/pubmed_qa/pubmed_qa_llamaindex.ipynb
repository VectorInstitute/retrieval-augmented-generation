    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook presents a RAG workflow for the [PubMed QA](https://pubmedqa.github.io/) task using [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/). The code is written in a configurable fashion, giving you the flexibility to edit the RAG configuration and observe the change in output/responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It covers a step-by-step procedure for building the RAG workflow (Stages 1-4) and later runs the pipeline on a sample from the dataset. The notebook also covers the sparse, dense, hybrid retrieval strategies along with the re-ranker. We have alse added an optional component for RAG evaluation using the [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI API key**:  \n",
    "    - Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an API key\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaviate vector database cluster**:  \n",
    "    - Create a free Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) cluster at [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.io/)\n",
    "    - After creation, copy the cluster URL (e.g., `https://your-cluster-id.weaviate.network`) and API key (Admin)\n"

      "The context information suggests that the exclusion of all HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation may not be justified. Recent advances in the management and prognosis of HIV-infected patients indicate that this policy should be reevaluated. While the majority of U.S. transplant centers currently do not perform transplants on asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, there is a recognition that these patients could potentially be good candidates for transplantation. The main concerns are related to the potential harm to the individual and the perceived waste of organs. However, with improved management of HIV, these concerns may be mitigated, suggesting that a blanket exclusion may not be appropriate. Therefore, the decision should be individualized, taking into account the specific health status and prognosis of the HIV-infected patient. No, not all HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease should be excluded from transplantation.\n",

      "The context information suggests that the policy of excluding HIV-infected patients from transplantation is being reevaluated due to recent advances in the management and prognosis of these patients. However, the majority of U.S. transplant centers still do not support transplanting kidneys into asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, citing concerns about potential harm to the individual and the belief that it might be a waste of organs. Despite these concerns, the fact that some centers are considering the possibility indicates that there is not a unanimous agreement on the exclusion policy.\n",

      "Given this context, it seems that a blanket exclusion of all HIV-infected patients from transplantation may not be justified, especially as medical advancements continue to improve the outcomes for these patients. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to evaluate each case individually rather than applying a universal exclusion policy. \n",
